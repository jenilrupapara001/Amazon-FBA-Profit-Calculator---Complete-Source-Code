### Database Schema
The application uses Prisma ORM with SQLite. Key tables:

- `POST /api/products` - Create new product entries
- `POST /api/products/single` - Add single product with fee calculation
- `GET /api/products/export` - Export products as Excel file

### Amazon Data
- `POST /api/fetch-amazon-data` - Fetch product data from Amazon using ASIN

## üéØ Fee Calculation Logic

### Referral Fees
Category-based percentage calculated on selling price:
```javascript
referralFee = sellingPrice * (referralFeePercent / 100)
```

### Closing Fees
Fixed fees based on price ranges:
- ‚Çπ0-250: ‚Çπ26
- ‚Çπ251-500: ‚Çπ12
- ‚Çπ501-1000: ‚Çπ20
- ‚Çπ1001+: ‚Çπ35

### Shipping Fees
Weight and region-based:
- Local: ‚Çπ40-120 based on weight
- Regional: ‚Çπ50-150 based on weight
- National: ‚Çπ60-180 based on weight

### Storage Fees
Calculated monthly based on product volume:
```javascript
storageFee = (length * width * height / 28316.84) * monthlyRate
```

- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful fallbacks for component errors
